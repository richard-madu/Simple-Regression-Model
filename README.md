## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of education, understanding the connection between study habits and academic success is paramount. This machine learning project aims to unravel this relationship using a dataset featuring students' study hours and test scores. By implementing a simple linear regression model, we seek to predict test scores based on study hours and provide valuable insights for educators and learners alike.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the project interactively)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/study-hours-test-scores.git
cd study-hours-test-scores

## Usage 
Explore the project files and notebooks to understand the data analysis and model implementation. Run the Jupyter notebooks for an interactive exploration.

## Results 
Our analysis revealed a positive correlation between study hours and test scores. The linear regression model successfully captures this relationship, allowing for the prediction of test scores based on study hours. The predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours is approximately 93.7%.
